# PureSDK for iOS

## Requirements
The iOS SDK is available for applications targeting iOS 9.0 and above.

## Installation
*You need a key to use this framework, please contact us if you don't yet have one.*

We currently support installation with Cocoapods and manual dynamic framework installation. 
If needed, we can also support Carthage. Shoot us a slack message or email and we can get it set up.

### Cocoapods

First off, find your key and add the following lines to your app's `Podfile` :

```ruby
use_frameworks!
pod 'PureSDK', :podspec => 'http://puresdk.azurewebsites.net/cocoapods/sdk/versions/latest?key=INSERT_KEY_HERE'
```

### Dynamic Framework

Download the latest version of the framework from :

`https://puresdk.azurewebsites.net/cocoapods/sdk/versions/1.0.61.zip?key=INSERT_KEY_HERE`

1. Open your project in Xcode.
2. Drag and drop `PureSDK.framework` into your project. Make sure the `Copy files` box is checked. *Uncheck* any selected targets. Click ok.
3. Select the target you wish to integrate the SDK into on the left-hand side of the project editor.
5. Find the `Embedded Binaries` section under `General`, and add the `PureSDK.framework` that you just included into your project. This will also add the framework to the `Linked Libraries and Frameworks` section.
6. Navigate to `Build Phases`, click the small `+` in the left area of the window, and click `New Run Script Phase`.
7. Paste the following line into the phase that was just added, and if you like rename the phase to "Strip Invalid Archs" :
`bash "${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/${FRAMEWORKS_FOLDER_PATH}/PureSDK.framework/strip-frameworks.sh"`
This script (written by the excellent team at RealmCocoa!) removes architecture slices that are used on the iOS simulator.

That's it! These instructions were last tested on Xcode 9.4 (9F1027a) and Xcode 10 (10L176w). For comparison, your `General` tab should look like this :

and the build phase "Strip Invalid Archs" should look like this :

![run-script](https://github.com/unacast/pure-sdk-ios/blob/master/run-script.png)

## Permissions

Some of the SDK's data collection sources require extra keys in `Info.plist`, and some require the user to accept a popup. We will never trigger the permission popups from our code. It is your responsibility to present the permission prompt alert at an appropriate time.

### Location

Here are the `Info.plist` keys that Apple requires for location tracking :

- `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` : Describes how your app will use location services in the foreground. You must include this key if you wish to collect location events.

- `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription` : Describes how your app will use location services and explains what extra features you can provide if the always option is selected. The presented alert gives the user the option between "Only when in use", "Always", and "Never". Only used on iOS 11 or later.

- `NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription` : Describes how your app will use location services, both in the foreground and background. The presented alert gives the user the option between "Always", and "Never". If your deployment target is at iOS 11 or higher, then you don't need this key even if you wish to collect location events.

Recap : if your application is targeting iOS 11 or higher and you wish to track location events, then only the `WhenInUseUsage` and `AlwaysAndWhenInUseUsage` plist keys are required.
If your application is targeting iOS 10 or below, then you need to include all keys for iOS 11 in addition to the `AlwaysUsage` key.

Find your app's `Info.plist`, right click, select `Open As`, tap `Source Code` and paste the keys you will be using. Remember, these keys will be shown to your users.

```xml
<!-- All iOS versions -->
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We'll show you interesting things around you.</string>

<!-- iOS 10 and below only -->
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We'll show you interesting things around you.</string>

<!-- iOS 11 and above only -->
<key>NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUsageDescription</key>
<string>We'll show you interesting things around you, and with the "always" option, we'll also send you notifications when you come across something cool.</string>
```

### Bluetooth

Apple requires all apps that import the `CoreBluetooth` framework to explicitly state its intention under the `NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription` key in the application's `Info.plist`. Because of this, our bluetooth tracking code comes bundled as an optional framework (`PureSDKBluetooth.framework`).

To install the framework, first double check that the `NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription` key is set to a reasonable string in your application's `Info.plist`. Failure to include this key will cause your app to be rejected on App Store Connect upload. Then, follow the instructions below depending on the preferred installation method. The `PureSDKBluetooth` framework cannot be installed independently from `PureSDK` since the bluetooth code requires the core SDK to function.

#### Coocoapods

To install the `PureSDKBluetooth` component, your podfile should contain this :

```ruby
use_frameworks!
pod 'PureSDK', :podspec => 'https://puresdk.azurewebsites.net/cocoapods/sdk/versions/latest?key=INSERT_KEY_HERE'
pod 'PureSDKBluetooth', :podspec => 'https://puresdk.azurewebsites.net/cocoapods/bluetooth/versions/latest?key=INSERT_KEY_HERE'
```

#### Dynamic Framework

The bluetooth framework can be downloaded at :
`https://puresdk.azurewebsites.net/cocoapods/bluetooth/versions/1.0.61.zip?key=INSERT_KEY_HERE`.

Then, follow instructions 1-7 as listed in  `Installation > Dynamic Framework`, except :
1. use `PureSDKBluetooth.framework` instead of `PureSDK.framework`.
2. add `bash "${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/${FRAMEWORKS_FOLDER_PATH}/PureSDKBluetooth.framework/strip-frameworks.sh"` as a new line. The finished "Strip Invalid Archs" run script should look like this :

![finished-run-script](https://github.com/unacast/pure-sdk-ios/blob/master/blt_run_script.png)

## Usage

Two method calls are required to get the SDK to start tracking :

First in, `AppDelegate.m didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`

```objc
[Pure initializeWithLaunchOptions:launchOptions];
```

Then, somewhere of your choosing (can be placed right after the above call if desired) : 

```objc
[Pure startTracking];
```

`initializeWithLaunchOptions` must be called before any other methods can be called on `Pure.h`

At any time, event collection can be stopped by calling :

```objc
[Pure stopTracking];
```

We recently added deprecation warnings for the `PureSDK` class because we moved to just `Pure`. In addition, (in version 1.0.59) added the `startTracking` call, which allows for better control of when the SDK tracks and when it doesn't. If you use the deprecated call `startTrackingWithLaunchOptions` call, this warning will be printed to the console :

> Warning, deprecated method used. SDK will not start. An additional call to `[Pure startTracking]` is required.

## Configuration

All config variables used by the SDK are provided by an external service. This means it's possible to change the behavior of the SDK without releasing a new version and configure settings per-device using filters based on device type, iOS version, etc.

## Custom Data

PureSDK provides additional methods to associate information with the current user session.

### Event

To create an "event", use :

```objc
[Pure createEventWithType:<#(nonnull NSString *)#> payload:<#(nonnull NSDictionary *)#> success:^{
    <#code#>
} failure:^(NSError * _Nullable error) {
    <#code#>
}];
```

The `type` describes what kind of event this is. Events are always added, not replaced.
Subsequent calls to `createEventWithType` with equal `type` values will create multiple events in the cloud. This method requires that the SDK has been started (`[Pure startTracking]`), and will return an error if that is not the case. To override this behavior, use the overloaded method and pass `YES` for the `force` parameter.

### Metadata

To associate some metadata with the current user, use :

```objc
[Pure associateMetadataWithType:<#(nonnull NSString *)#> payload:<#(nonnull NSDictionary *)#> success:^{
    <#code#>
} failure:^(NSError * _Nullable error) {
    <#code#>
}];
```

The `type` has to be unique for each payload you want to preserve.
Subsequent calls to `associateMetadataWithType` with equal `type` values will overwrite the data sent on previous calls. This method requires that the SDK has been started (`[Pure startTracking]`), and will return an error if that is not the case. To override this behavior, use the overloaded method and pass `YES` for the `force` parameter.

We recently deprecated the old event methods and tweaked the naming a little (added "withType" for a better Swift interface), but the old calls will continue to work until they are removed from the SDK. Warnings will be displayed if deprecated methods are used.

## Event Types

Here is an overview of what kinds of data we collect and upload.

1. Location
2. iBeacons
3. Network Connection

If the `PureSDKBluetooth` framework is installed, we also collect :

4. Eddystone UID
5. Eddystone URL

Sample Location Event :

```json
{
    "vacc":17.2101072,
    "updated":"2018-04-26T01:41:23+00:00",
    "hacc":1414.0000256,
    "lon":-122.1871488,
    "lat":37.8745792,
    "type":"LOCATION",
    "altitude":69.7735168,
    "timestamp":"2018-04-26T01:41:24+00:00"
}
```

Sample iBeacon Event :

```json
{
    "minor": 2,
    "rssi": 3,
    "major": 1,
    "type": "IBEACON",
    "timestamp": "2018-02-09T19:14:15-08:00",
    "uuid": "2F234454-CF6D-4A0F-ADF2-F4911BA9FFA6"
}
```

Each event has additional identifying information sent with it to determine the state of the user's device.
